## Idea

We want to build something for the students' community. We are planning to build something along the lines of Personal Finance for Students.

Mostly the college students who have just come out of the school don't really know how finance works.

When you come to hostel your parents hand you over a card or some cash and say "Here is your money for the month, spend it wisely". But most of the students don't know how to spend it wisely. They end up spending it on unnecessary things and end up with no money left at the end of the month.

We want to build a platform where students can learn about personal finance and also track their expenses.
